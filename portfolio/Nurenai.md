This is Nurenai, an IoT clothesline.
It receives weather forecasts from Wi-Fi, detects rain or snow, and automatically evacuates the laundry to the storage box.
When the rain stops, it hangs the laundry out to dry again.
It also has a timer function that can be activated at regular intervals each day, protecting laundry from night dew and providing a security measure.
It can also be linked to a smartphone to forcibly store and dry laundry.
