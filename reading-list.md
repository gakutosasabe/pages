## _Personal Profile_
GAKUTO SASABE was born in Japan, in 1992. He received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronic engineering.from the Tokyo University of
Agriculture and Technology, and the M.E. degreein information technology from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2018, un‑
der the supervision of Prof. Yasuhiro Miyake. After working on the development of the delivery of the Auto dish‑serving system as a Robotics
Technician, he is currently involved in the development of semiconductor manufacturing equipment as a Software Engineer. He is interested in
augmenting human capabilities using technologies such as AR, VR and electrical engineering, as well as insights from cognitive psychology and
human‑computer interaction.

## _Interests_

### Reserch
Human Augmentation, Human Computer Interaction ,cognitive phycology,ghost engineering, Embodied cognition, AR/VR/MR

### Maker
On weekends, he gathers with company volunteers and engages in maker activities, including the creation of body augmentation
devices. They also participate in Makers Faire twice a year.

## _University Projects_
### Increasing walking stride and speed by synchronization with avatar walking using mixed reality
#### School of Computing, Tokyo Institute of Technology
##### Apr 2016 - Apr 2018
- A 3D avatar whose walking rhythm was synchronized with the user was prepared, and the avatar was presented in front of the user by Hololens.
- Existing studies have attempted to improve gait by presenting rhythm as sound or timing as cue, but have not attempted to present gait as it is.
- Two types of avatars are provided: one that walks normally and one that has a large arm swing and foot lift.
- We checked for changes in walking speed and stride length in the two groups that walked while showing each avatar.
- The results showed that walking speed and stride length were significantly greater for users who showed avatars with greater arm and leg swing
- Technical Skills: C#, Unity, Statistics, R, Psychological experiment design
- Soft Skills: Time Management, Teamwork, Presentation skills, Report writing.
- Paper : [Spatiotemporal Gait Guidance Using Audiovisual Cues of Synchronized Walking Avatar in Augmented Reality](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9864197)

### Research on analysis methods for temporal signal changes in moving object detection.
#### Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology
##### Apr 2010 - Mar 2011
- Clustering of temperature information by weather using DTW, RealAdaboost, and SVM as a study of machine learning of time series data.
- Next, we attempted to detect motion based on the time-series data of luminance information at a certain coordinate in the video.
- We created two waveforms, one connecting endpoints formed by monotonically increasing to monotonically decreasing time series data, and the other connecting endpoints formed by monotonically decreasing to monotonically increasing time series data.
- The width of the two segmented linearized waveforms enables more detailed detection of moving objects than the detection of moving objects using a single Gaussian distribution.
- Technical Skills: C++, Machine learning, Image recognition, Latex
- Soft Skills: Time Management, Teamwork, Presentation skills, Report writing.
